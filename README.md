We built an AI Workout Trainer that uses real-time skeleton tracking to count reps, correct form, and give instant feedback â€” all from a smartphone camera. It makes fitness safer, more accessible, and private by reducing injury risks, eliminating barriers like cost or harassment, and encouraging consistent healthy habits. Our vision is a scalable, sustainable way to bring personal training to anyone, anywhere.
